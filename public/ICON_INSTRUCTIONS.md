# PWA Icon Setup Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create and add the following icon files to the `public/` directory:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixels
4. **favicon.ico** - 32x32 pixels

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator
1. Create a 512x512px icon with a table tennis paddle or your preferred design
2. Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
3. Upload your 512x512 image
4. Download the generated icons
5. Place them in this `public/` directory

### Option 2: Create Manually
Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.) to create:
- A square image with your app logo/icon
- Save it at 512x512px
- Resize and save copies at the required dimensions above

## Design Suggestions
- Use a table tennis paddle icon
- Use a ping pong ball
- Use your initials on a colored background
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use your app's primary color (#1976D2 blue) as the background

## Quick Placeholder
For testing purposes, you can use a simple colored square with text:
- Background: #1976D2 (blue)
- Text: "TT" or a table tennis emoji 🏓
- Font: Bold, white color

Once you add these icons, your PWA will be fully installable on mobile devices and desktops!
